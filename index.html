<p>At some point it felt dystopian to think stuff like <strong>"If you don't pay for the product, you are the product"</strong> but we're even farther than that now, we pay a lot for the product, and we're still the product.</p>

<p>I think it's worth mentioning that if it wasn't for piracy, a lot of old films might have been lost to time. Piracy alone has kept so much classical media alive due to so many companies either not caring about preserving their products or outright not making them with longevity in mind
I am extremely grateful for the software pirates from the last 40+ years. Without them, most of what is now termed as 'digital archeology' would be lost to bit rot and magnetic flux migration.</p>

<p>It’s amazing how much care pirates put into their releases compared to the studios. I’ve seen Blu Ray rips that compile four or five different sources to give you the best video, audio, and subtitles possible. Netflix is like “720p, that’s the best I can do" even after buying the 4K tier you are receiving a 720p bitrate</p>
